# SemanticProver
# Kevin O'Neill and Mitchell Mellone

SemanticProver is an implementation on a truth-functional metatheory of logic which manipulates explicitly stored truth assignments in order to solve both propositional and metalogical problems. SemanticProver.jar is our latest release which contains a GUI to display truth assignment trees for any given proof.
